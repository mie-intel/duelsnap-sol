  const prompt = `You are a strict quality gatekeeper for a global picture-guessing game played by all ages.

Your job: verify whether the image is suitable as a question where players must guess the word "${answer}".

VERIFICATION RULES — apply all strictly:

1. ANSWER MATCH (matchesAnswer):
   - The claimed answer "${answer}" must be the PRIMARY, DOMINANT subject of the image.
   - If a player looks at this image and guesses "${answer}", it must feel OBVIOUS and CORRECT.
   - Reject if: the answer word only appears as a background element, minor detail, or partial subject.
   - Reject if: the image shows something that COULD be called "${answer}" but equally fits 3+ other words.
   - Reject if: the answer word is a stretch, metaphor, or abstract interpretation of the image.
   - Example PASS: image of a banana → answer "BANANA". Clear, unambiguous, primary subject.
   - Example FAIL: image of a fruit bowl with one banana → answer "BANANA". Banana is not dominant.
   - Example FAIL: image of a sunset → answer "BEAUTIFUL". Abstract, not a concrete object.

2. UNIVERSALITY (isUniversal):
   - The answer word must be recognizable to players worldwide regardless of culture or language.
   - Reject if: the answer is a local brand, regional food, person's name, or location-specific object.
   - Pass: "BICYCLE", "CAT", "GUITAR", "UMBRELLA" — globally understood concrete nouns.
   - Fail: "OJEK", "RENDANG", "JAKARTA", names of people.

3. SAFETY (isSafe):
   - Reject any NSFW content, violence, gore, hate symbols, or inappropriate content for all ages.

4. DIFFICULTY:
   - easy: most 10-year-olds worldwide would guess correctly in under 5 seconds.
   - medium: clear subject but requires a moment of thought.
   - hard: recognizable but obscure — most adults would need more than 10 seconds.

5. CONFIDENCE (0.0 to 1.0):
   - Your certainty that "${answer}" is the correct and obvious label for this image.
   - Score below 0.7 means the image is ambiguous — treat as rejection.

  "isSafe": boolean,
  "matchesAnswer": boolean,
  "confidence": number,
  "difficulty": "easy" | "medium" | "hard",
  "isUniversal": boolean,
  "rejectReason": string | null
}

If rejecting, rejectReason must be a short, specific explanation (e.g. "Answer is not the primary subject", "Image is NSFW", "Answer word is culturally specific").
If passing, rejectReason must be null.`;
